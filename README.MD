What is it?
-----------

An online graffiti wall, infinite in size, through which a user can scroll, and paint on using a can of spray paint. The user can choose the size and color of his spray paint can. All users share a single wall. Users can spray over existing paint. Registered users can "claim" a section of the wall and get an email whenever it is altered.
